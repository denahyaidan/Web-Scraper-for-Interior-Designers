#Interior Design Scraper

Search for up to 50 products in one minute. An easy way for interior designers to collect pertinent data including dimensions, make, color, and more from top brands.

I have pre-loaded a series of URLs for a test run. Simply clone the repo -> "npm i" -> "node app.js"

The web scraper will begin buzzing, collecting data on the URLs, as well as downloading images of each item. It will finally export this all into an excel sheet called "output.xlsx" within the repo. It takes temporary screenshots along the way just in case there is any issue with navigation.

Right now the scraper works on build.com and kohler.com, but more sites to come.
